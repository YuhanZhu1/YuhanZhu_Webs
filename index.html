            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="highlight">
            I'm passionate about physics, computational modeling, new technology, and all things cool. I love traveling, photography, music, and making coffee. I'm always excited about working on different projects across various fields and consider myself a 'solution-giver' or 'problem-solver.' I excel at using data and analytical skills to answer questions, make sense of results, and address the 'How' and 'Why.' I'm hands-on, whether it's fixing water pipes, assembling computers, simulating the solar system, or conducting gamma-ray spectrum experiments. I'm constantly adding new skills to my toolkit every day.
