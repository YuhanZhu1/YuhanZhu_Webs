                <em>I'm passionate about physics, computational modeling, new technology, and all things cool. I love traveling, photography, music, and making coffee. I'm always excited about working on different projects across various fields and consider myself a 'solution-giver' or 'problem-solver.' I excel at using data and analytical skills to answer questions, make sense of results, and address the 'How' and 'Why.' I'm hands-on, whether it's fixing water pipes, assembling computers, simulating the solar system, or conducting gamma-ray spectrum experiments. I'm constantly adding new skills to my toolkit every day.</em>

                "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." 1 Corinthians 13:4-6

            <h2>Music & Books</h2>
            <p>I recently read the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3WIa82H">Millionaire Teacher: The Nine Rules of Wealth You Should Have Learned in School</a>. My favorite book is something I might discover in the future, but for now, this one stands out.</p>
