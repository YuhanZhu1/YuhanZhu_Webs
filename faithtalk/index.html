          But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth.  
          He will not speak on His own; He will speak only what He hears,  
          and He will tell you what is yet to come.

    <p><strong>FaithTalk</strong> is a tool, not a teacher. While powered by language models, it may respond imperfectly. It may help you explore spiritual truth, but wisdom and guidance come from God alone.</p>
  
    <p>💙 Thank you for spending time here. May you walk away encouraged and never alone.</p>
